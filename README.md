This repository contains android code for a simple app that can search through github repositories and users.

It is intended to serve as a basis for android tech assignments. As such it is not intended to be "production complete" in any sense. 
But to serve as a foundation for exploring ways to extend, improve and refactor functionality - both in terms of user and developer experience.
